        <p class="para">Watermelon is juicy, sweet and large fruit. It is very popular among all ages whether children, adults or aged people.

            It satisfies the need of quench of summers due to which it is known as summer cooler. Its cooling agents provide relaxation and respite from the burning sun.

            Different color watermelons taste a little different from each other because of the substance that gives them their color.

            The red color of water melons is due to the lycopene present in it. The amount of lycopene present in watermelons determines the amount of color in watermelons.

            Watermelons are of different types. Some have green rind on the outside and red-pink flesh inside while some have yellow flesh inside too.

            This is due to the different enzymes present in them which brings a variation in its color, taste and size. The flesh can be seedless, depending on the variety of the fruit.

            Watermelonâ€™s outer rind is not edible but it can be used as vegetable. The rind can also be pickled to preserve it after the addition of preservatives.

            Mostly watermelons are spherical, round or oblong in shape and they come from a vine-like plant. They generally grow on creepers but the creepers are not climbers.

            Watermelons are bulky and heavy. Thus the tendrils are not strong enough to bear the weight of the heavy fruit.

            Watermelons are a rich source of vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin B6 and vitamin B1. They also have a high amount of potassium, magnesium, carotenoid antioxidant and lycopene.



            Watermelon is an annual fruiting vine that requires a relatively long, hot growing season to produce the iconic summertime treat familiar to picnickers everywhere. Watermelon is one member of the very large Cucurbitaceae family of plants, a group that includes most of the vining vegetables, including cucumbers, squash, and pumpkins. The watermelons grown in domestic gardens are all cultivars of the Citrillus lunatus species. Watermelon has been in cultivation for many centuries, thought to have originated almost 5,000 years ago in the Kalahari Desert of Africa. Seeds were brought to the U.S. by enslaved Africans. Thanks to hybridizing, there are over 100 cultivated varieties of watermelons, in assorted sizes, shapes, and colors.

            Watermelon is a sprawling, prostate vining plant with large, lobed leaves with a hairy, coarse texture. They bloom with yellow flowers in mid- to late-summer. The deliciously edible fruits with thick rinds grow and ripen quickly for harvest in late summer and early fall. Each plant produces two to four watermelon fruits.

            Modern watermelon cultivars are categorized into four groups:

            Picnic melons are jumbo-sized, 15 to 50 pounds.
            Icebox melons are smaller family-sized fruits, 5 to 15 pounds.
            Seedless melons are hybrids bred to be self-sterile. They weigh 10 to 20 pounds.
            Yellow/orange-fleshed melons are often considered to be sweeter than red and pink watermelons.
            Watermelons are generally planted from seeds sown directly into the garden as soon as the soil warms to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. In cool regions with short growing seasons, seeds are started indoors two to four weeks before last frost date. Most watermelons take 80 to 90 days to mature, although there are short-season varieties are ready to harvest about 70 days after the seedlings sprout </p>
